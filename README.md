# COVID-19 Datasets for AWS Data Exchange

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a high demand for COVID related datasets for researchers and institutions fighting this pandemic. Rearc is committed to making these datasets available to subscribers via the AWS Data Exchange platform. 

AWS Data Exchange (ADX) is a data marketplace that connects data providers with data subscribers in an easy effective way leveraging the AWS ecosystem of cloud tools and services. Anyone can become a data provider and get access to a growing set of data subscribers on the AWS platform. For subscribers, it makes it a unified experience acquiring data from reliable sources with a simplified subscription and billing experience. Subscribers can gain agility and meaningful insights from multiple datasets on the ADX platform. 

We are tirelessly working to figure out which datasets are important to our subscribers. Additionally, there are several data providers that are interested in making their data available on the ADX platform but do not have the resources to do so themselves. On the flip side, many data subscribers need access to these datasets in a more manageable and meaningful fashion but do not have the skills and/or resources to maintain data from disparate sources and feed them into their existing and new data pipelines. 

We want to make it easy for potential subscribers to request public datasets they are interested in by opening up a github issue under this project or simply asking us a question by emailing us at info@rearc.io.
