# COVID-19 Datasets for AWS Data Exchange

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a high demand for related datasets for researchers and institutions fighting it. Rearc is committed to making these datasets available to subscribers via the [AWS Data Exchange](https://aws.amazon.com/data-exchange/) platform. [Read more](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/a-public-data-lake-for-analysis-of-covid-19-data/) about how these Rearc-published datasets are being used to power the public AWS COVID-19 data lake.

AWS Data Exchange (ADX) is a data marketplace that connects data providers with data subscribers in an easy effective way leveraging the AWS ecosystem of cloud tools and services. Anyone can become a data provider and get access to a growing set of data subscribers on the AWS platform. For subscribers, it makes it a unified experience acquiring data from reliable sources with a simplified subscription and billing experience. Subscribers can gain agility and meaningful insights from multiple datasets on the ADX platform. 

We at Rearc are tirelessly working to figure out which datasets are important to our subscribers. Open issues are being prioritized on our [project board](https://github.com/rearc-data/covid-datasets-aws-data-exchange/projects/1). If you are interested in seeing a different public dataset on the ADX platform, please [open an issue](https://github.com/rearc-data/covid-datasets-aws-data-exchange/issues/new) on this repository.

If you are a data provider interested in making your proprietary data available on the ADX platform with Rearc's help, or simply have a question, reach us at [info@rearc.io](mailto:info@rearc.io).
